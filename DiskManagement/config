#show disk list
lsblk
#create partition from disk
fdisk /dev/namedisk
#make new part into a ext4 storage for Linux to read/write into it
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
mkfs: make file system
e2fsck: etx2, etx3, etx4 filesystem check
resize2fs: ext2, ext3, ext4 filesystem resize
#when you use mount this will only work in this session
#reboot it will not mount anymore
#on boot Linux will read /etc/fstab to know what file to mount
#file -s /dev/sdb1 to see UUID
#to extend part like fully extend remaining disk storage
sudo growpart /dev/sdb 1 
#if want to change into actual size like 12Gb use parted or fdisk
sudo parted /dev/sdb
(parted) print
(parted) resizepart 1 12GB
(parted) quit

flow:
create new disk: 
-create new part
-create new filesystem
-mount filesystem
-to auto mount on reboot use file -s to see UUID
-add device to /etc/fstab
extend disk:
-resize disk in VM
-resize partition with parted
-resize filesystem
